      <p> Do you want to dance with me?
        Sure. Now?
        Mm-hmm.
        Here?
        Mm-hmm.
        Not supposed to dance in the middle of the street.
        Who said dance in the street?
        And we don't have any music.
        Well, we'll make some.
        Bum bum Bum bum bum Bum Bum bum Bum bum bum bum bum.
        You're a terrible singer.
        I know.
        But I like this song..
        <!-- <br>
        - You're bored. You're bored and you know it. You wouldn't be here if there wasn't something missing.
        - You arrogant son of a bitch!
        - Would you just stay with me?
        - Stay with you? What for? Look at us, we're already fighting.
        - Well, that's what we do. We fight. You tell me when I'm being an arrogant son of a bitch
        and I tell you when you're a pain in the ass. Which you are, 99% of the time. I'm not afraid to hurt your
        feelings.
        They have like a two second rebound rate and you're back doing the next pain-in-the-ass thing.
        - So, what?
        - So it's not gonna be easy. It's gonna be really hard. And we're gonna have to work at this every day,
        but I want to do that, because I want you. I want all of you, forever, you and me, every day.
        Will you do something for me? Please? Will you just picture your life for me? years from now,
        years from now, what's it look like? If it's with that guy, go! Go! I lost you once, I think I could do it again,
        if I thought it's what you really wanted. But don't you take the easy way out.
        - What easy way? There is no easy way, no matter what I do, somebody gets hurt.
        - Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants. Stop thinking about what I want, what he wants,
        what your parents want. What do you want? What do you want?
        - It's not that simple.
        - What do you want?
        - It's not...
        - Goddamn it, what do you want? -->

        skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
