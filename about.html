      <h2>Christopher T. Kuveke</h2>
      <h3>Principal, Head of Research</h3>
      <p>Christopher started Tiger Moth with the vision of infusing a foundational understanding of 
        climate change into financial, legislative and corporate decision-making. Having studied 
        hydrogeology and climate sciences prior to a burgeoning career in finance, Christopher is 
        aware of the intricacies of earth systems and the role of human impact in the anthropocene. 
        He believes that corporations can act as stewards of sustainability given the right knowledge
        and is happy to help identify bad actors when necessary. Christopher has worked with 
        numerous NGOs, policy think-tanks, and private corporations to guide corporate practices, 
        influence legislation, reduce corporate impact on the environment, and protect at-risk 
        populations from polluters. 

        Christopher and his work have been cited by the United States Congress, the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, Gizmodo and many other news publications. He has been an expert witness for the House Oversight and Budget committees and advisor to numerous senators for both hearings and legislation.
        
        Before starting Tiger Moth, Christopher was a broker on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and a financial analyst. He received his BSc from the University of Connecticut in geology with a concentration in hydrogeology. He lives in Brooklyn, NY.
