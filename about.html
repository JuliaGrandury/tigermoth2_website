      <p>Tiger Moth was started in 2018. Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived 
        together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. 
        Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the 
        world needed him most, he vanished.</p>

        <h3>Principal, Head of Research</h3>
        <img src="images/chrisprofile.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Christopher started Tiger Moth with the vision of infusing a foundational understanding of
          climate change into financial, legislative and corporate decision-making. Having studied
          hydrogeology and climate sciences prior to a burgeoning career in finance, Christopher is
          aware of the intricacies of earth systems and the role of human impact in the anthropocene.
          He believes that corporations can act as stewards of sustainability given the right knowledge
          and is happy to help identify bad actors when necessary. Christopher has worked with
          numerous NGOs, policy think-tanks, and private corporations to guide corporate practices,
          influence legislation, reduce corporate impact on the environment, and protect at-risk
          populations from polluters.
          Christopher and his work have been cited by the United States Congress, the New York Times, The Wall Street
          Journal, The Guardian, Gizmodo and many other news publications. He has been an expert witness for the House
          Oversight and Budget committees and advisor to numerous senators for both hearings and legislation.
          Before starting Tiger Moth, Christopher was a broker on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and a
          financial analyst. He received his BSc from the University of Connecticut in geology with a concentration in
          hydrogeology. He lives in Brooklyn, NY.
